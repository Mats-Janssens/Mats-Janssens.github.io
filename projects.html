                                    A third semester engineering project. 
                                    We were free to do whatever we wanted as long as 
                                    we were detecting cards and recognising hand gestures.

                                    We decided to build a robot as to make the game more interactive.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>

                                    The robot can play blackjack and present the game on the screen. 
                                    It's quite easy to add new games but we did not have time. 
                                    The robot gives the different players a card. 
                                    It reads in which card was dispensed using a small camera.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Then it asks the player for a bet. 
                                    The player enters the bet and makes the ok sign (ðŸ‘Œ). 
                                    It repeats this for all the players. 
                                    Then the game starts and the players can do different things 
                                    based on their hand symbol.

                                    Powerpedal was a one year project in the last year of highschool. 
                                    We were with four people. The purpose of the project was to make 
                                    a small business called a "mini-onderneming".
                                    We made a device to charge your phone while cycling.
                                    At a normal speed(20km/h) it would charge 1% per 2 minutes.
                                    We sold 45 of these at a price of â‚¬25.

                                    I made this promotional video was for a competion. We got second in Belgium.
